Various methods to migrate an
[Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/psr-b1919-21) to a
standalone webpage.

The recommended method is to bundle all the modules into a single JavaScript
file, and deploy to now.sh:
[Method - Bundle all modules into a local JavaScript file](./bundle_js_and_deploy)

Other more trivial methods:

- [download and extract tgz from Observable notebook](./default_observable_export/README.md)
  to use the default index.html file provided in the tgz file
- [get JavaScript modules from api.observablehq.com](./request_observable_api/README.md)
  at runtime
