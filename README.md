## Using ObservableHQ runtime

An Observable notebook can be run as a standalone application using the
[`@observable/runtime` library](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime),
outside of the Observable platform.

The recommended method is to bundle all the modules into a single JavaScript
file, and deploy to now.sh:
[Bundle all modules into a local JavaScript file](./bundle_js_and_deploy)

Other more trivial methods:

- [download and extract tgz from Observable notebook](./default_observable_export/README.md)
  to use the default index.html file provided in the tgz file
- [get JavaScript modules from api.observablehq.com](./request_observable_api/README.md)
  at runtime

## Independent of ObservableHQ runtime

A totally different approach to migrate an Observable notebook to a standalone
application is to rewrite the code from scratch.

See the ["rewrite from scratch" method](./rewrite_from_scratch).
