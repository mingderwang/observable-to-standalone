# Observable notebook to standalone application

Various methods to migrate an
[Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/psr-b1919-21) to a
standalone webpage.

## Using ObservableHQ runtime

An Observable notebook can be run as a standalone application using the
[`@observable/runtime` library](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime),
outside of the Observable platform.

The recommended method is to bundle all the modules into a single JavaScript
file, and deploy to now.sh:
[Bundle all modules into a local JavaScript file](./bundle_js_and_deploy)

Other more trivial methods:

- [download and extract tgz from Observable notebook](./default_observable_export/README.md)
  to use the default index.html file provided in the tgz file
- [get JavaScript modules from api.observablehq.com](./request_observable_api/README.md)
  at runtime

## Independent of ObservableHQ runtime

A totally different approach to migrate an Observable notebook to a standalone
application is to rewrite the code from scratch.

Pros:

- the code can be versioned in a traditional way (comparing to the
  [Observable cells-based code](./bundle_js_and_deploy/joyplot/step6/src/notebook/@mbostock/psr-b1919-21.js))
- easier to incorporate into your favorite framework

Cons:

- you need to manage the state, instead of letting the Observable runtime do it
  for you
- related: you cannot make a simple use of Observable features like `viewof` or
  [inputs elements](https://observablehq.com/@jashkenas/inputs) for example
- migration might be a complex and manual process

Other differences:

- the code is available at build time, not at runtime

See the ["rewrite from scratch" method](./rewrite_from_scratch).
