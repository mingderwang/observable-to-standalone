[Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/psr-b1919-21) to a
standalone webpage.

Three tutorials are proposed:

1. [download and extract tgz from Observable notebook](./1_default_observable_export/README.md)
   to use the default index.html file provided in the tgz file
2. [get JavaScript modules from api.observablehq.com](./2_request_observable_api/README.md)
   at runtime
3. [bundle all modules](./3_bundle_js_and_deploy) into a single JavaScript file,
   and deploy to now.sh
